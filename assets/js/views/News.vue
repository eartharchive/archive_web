      <h1>Introducing the Archived.Earth <span>December 30.12.2018</span> </h1>

        In his last Wikipedia fundraising email of 2018, Jimmy Wales used an analogy that “just as our society will collapse without sustainable shepherding of the environment, the information that underpins the internet must be protected.” Environmental concerns are familiar to (and supported by) many, but the condition of the environment itself now depends on digital systems to gather, transmit, store, and process information, as well as facilitate diverse groups’ contribution to and -benefit from advanced capabilities.
        <br><br>    
      </p>

      <p style="font-weight:700;">
        We still need a planetary-scale facility to store -- and raise use of -- scientifically-derived knowledege on the environment. This relates to the need for robust digital media, articulated by computing and internet pioneers like Doug Engelbart, Ted Nelson, and others.

        The goal of Archive.Earth is immutable, uncensorable, and globally accessible infrastructure for environmental knowledge, that can be drawn on by others to enhance use of environmental information in the online world. Its content is of highest possible spatiotemporal resolution, regularly updated from peer-reviewed literature then further filtered by expert committees. The datasets are then further made available for use by others, ranging from farmers and agronomists, to government actors across scales.
        <br>
        <br>
        The technical requirement of a permanent, globally-accessible, -scalable, and
        <br>
        -relevant capability is met by combining several technologies: a system for distributed data storage, use of online platforms that host both the raw data and analytical programs, as well as using both web-based and on-premise hardware for model generation and on-demand data assimilation.
        <br>
        <br>
        The activity of the non-profit project is to use donated capacity on distributed data storage technologies such as blockweave, as well as provide necessary bindings for integration with scientific workflows and enterprise/government systems to support full workflows from creation to use of environmental data. Depending on the type of information and the context of its use, raw data may be logged in real time, during cleaning and publishing, or even activities which were informed by it.
        <br>
        <br>
        workflows by creators like OpenGeoHub, extended to users by full-stack awareness.. Our interest is motivated by:
        <br>
        <br>
        - Science in general is increasingly technology-driven, from tools to capture observations, to those used to analyse, publish, disseminate, and educate.
        <br>
        - Environmental science in particular relies on remotely-sensed (satellite, UAV, IoT) data and statistical processing for model-based insight on spatiotemporal data. Complex results required sophisticated usage tools.
        <br>
        - Environmental research and impact assessments are often politicised at local to international scales. As awareness of social/economic costs of pollution and ecological loss grows, there are interests to “lose” records. Pledges for “digitization” have sometimes been used to cover-up data loss.

              There is tendency in some countries to dismiss allegations of corruption or interference with environmental science and activism, yet in every part of the world, in private and public sectors, and all levels of government there are examples of interference with environmental politics. Egregious examples are given below, followed by a description of this project to date, and roadmap.

            Before taking office in 2019, Brazil’s environment minister Ricardo Salles was convicted on 12/19/2018 for impropriety as Environment Secretary in São Paulo State, having “modified maps developed by University of São Paulo, amended [a] draft of the management plan…and persecution to employees of Forest Foundation to benefit business sectors, especially mining companies” [S].
            <br>
                <br>
                    Despite a sentence banning Salles from elected office for 3 years, the role of Brazil’s national Minister of Environment is by appointment, and he enjoys support of Bolsonaro and Brazil’s agrilobby. This conviction comes after many campaign-trail interview statements supporting expansion of agricultural activity into the Amazon and disparaging the indigenous groups still there, while dismissing many environmental fines as “ideological,” and questioning published reports on Brazilian deforestation and climate change risks [s2].
                    <br>
                        <br>
                            Among the pledges Salles has made is to “make Brazil’s environmental licensing and fines system transparent by putting it online.” In a context of the above conviction and comments, this ‘digitization’ excuse has been a cover-up before: in 2012, the federal minority government of Canada led by Stephen Harper passed legislation in its Jobs, Growth, and Long-Term Prosperity Act that was condemned for stripping environmental protections and safeguards from thousands of waterways, permanently closed major environmental research projects as well as scientific libraries resulting in “irreplaceable” loss of knowledge [Z].
